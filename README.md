## What WE did to install Qiskit
https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html
https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/machine-learning/getting_started.html

### Install venv
python -m venv ./venv

### Activate venv (windows PowerShell) (you need to activate it every time you want to use it)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

### If error of security policy occurs
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

### Install Qiskit
pip install qiskit

### Install Qiskit Visualization for Jupyter
pip install qiskit[visualization]

### See the active packages in the virtual environment
pip list

### Install Qiskit Machine Learning
pip install qiskit[machine-learning]

### Install Sklearn (to use dataset)
pip install scikit-learn

### Install ipykernel (to use the virtual environment in Jupyter)
pip install ipykernel

### Add the virtual environment to Jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv

## Subject
Keywords: Quantum machine learning, data driven security, intrusion detection systems, NSL-KDD.
Synopsis:
Several traditional machine learning based intrusion detection systems approaches showed high accu- racy in detecting and classifying network intrusions. However, the performance of training these mod- els degrades as the training dataset increases in size.
Quantum machine learning (QML) has attracted the attention of the scientific community as an alterna- tive to traditional machine learning to alleviate performance issues.
The objective of this research is to explore the use of QML to driven data security and to implement ef- ficient intrusion detection systems.
